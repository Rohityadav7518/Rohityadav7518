### 👋 Hi, I'm Rohit Yadav 

I’m an independent programmer from India, fueled by open-source, automation, and building tools that click. I spend my days taming terminals and nights fragging in FPS matches. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new places with my camera or chasing golden-hour light.

My zen? A perfectly tuned  the click of a mechanical keyboard, and freezing life’s fleeting moments into frames. Let’s chat about Linux sorcery, crypto & bots, or FPS tactics!
